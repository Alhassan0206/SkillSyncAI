1. Executive summary / Project brief (single sentence)

SkillSync AI is an AI-driven multi-tenant web platform that analyzes people’s skills and project requirements, generates optimized learning and hiring roadmaps, and automatically matches job-seekers with employers — exposed via three dashboards (Job-Seeker Dashboard, Employer Dashboard, Platform Admin Dashboard) and a public marketing site.

2. High-level goals & success metrics

Goals

Reduce time-to-hire and improve match quality for employers.

Increase users’ employability via personalized skill roadmaps.

Reach $50K–$100K MRR through subscriptions and B2B API licensing.

Core Success Metrics

MRR, Churn rate, CAC, LTV

Match Acceptance Rate (target ≥ 40% → 60% over time)

Time from Project Posted → First Hire (target reduce by 50%)

Monthly Active Users (MAU) and DAU/MAU ratio

Average Fit Score of hired matches

3. Personas

Job-Seeker (Individual) — early-career to mid-career professionals searching for jobs and learning paths.

Recruiter / Hiring Manager (Employer user) — posts jobs, reviews matches, hires and tracks analytics.

Platform Admin (Internal) — manages tenants, monitors system health, moderates content, support, billing.

Guest / Visitor — prospective user who reads marketing pages, signs up.

Key fields:

projects.required_skills (jsonb array)

candidates.raw_skills (jsonb)

projects.embedding_id and candidates.embedding_id (string pointer to vector DB)

matches.score numeric and matches.explanation text

Indexes: tenant-based indexes and partial indexes on status. RLS recommended.

9. API contract (selected critical endpoints — full OpenAPI recommended)

Provide a minimal contract here for priority endpoints (examples — production should use OpenAPI file):

POST /v1/auth/signup

Request: { email, password, name, role }

Response: { accessToken, refreshToken, user }

POST /v1/projects

Request: { title, description, required_skills, seniority, budget } + auth header

Accept resume file -> returns candidate_id and parse_job_id for async parsing.

POST /v1/webhooks/stripe

Handle invoice.paid, invoice.payment_failed, customer.subscription.deleted.

10. UX & UI guidelines (usability standards)

Keep the “3-click” rule to reach primary actions.

Progressive disclosure: show simple summaries and allow deeper view for details.

Use onboarding modal with progress indicators and highlight required fields.

Use consistent CTAs: primary (solid) for main actions; secondary (outline) for auxiliary actions.

Provide empty-state suggestions (e.g., when no matches show how to improve profile).

Accessibility: font sizes, color contrast, semantic HTML.

11. Testing & QA plan

Unit testing: Jest (backend), Vitest (frontend).

Integration: Supertest / Playwright for API + UI end-to-end.

Load testing: k6 or Locust to simulate matching pipeline under load.

ML tests: Regression tests on embeddings (sanity checks) and blind test sample sets.

Security scans: Snyk / Dependabot / pip-audit.

12. Monitoring & alerts (SRE)

Application metrics: p95 latency, error rate, request rate.

Business metrics: new signups, paid conversions, match acceptance rate.

Worker metrics: job queue length, ML latency, vector DB errors.

Alerts: high error rate (>1%), ML latency > 2s for parse, queue length > threshold.

13. Roadmap & milestones (12 months, high-level)

M0 (Prep): Repo + infra + skeleton services, auth, DB models.

M1 (MVP Q1): Signup, resume upload/parse, project create/parse, basic matching, tenant onboarding, Stripe billing.

Repo scaffold: services/api (NestJS), services/ml (FastAPI), worker, web (React).

Example env files & secrets guide

Acceptance test checklist

16. Edge cases & considerations

Duplicate candidates across tenants (public profiles) — ensure dedup via hashed email/GitHub id.

Resume parsing failures: provide manual edit UI.

Cross-tenant data leakage: mandatory RLS or separate DB for enterprise.

Rate-limited third-party APIs (LinkedIn, OpenAI): implement backoff and caching.

Handling GDPR deletion: cascade delete vs anonymization (configurable per tenant).

17. Communications & support

Integrated help center with context-sensitive tips.

In-app chat for enterprise users (support plan).

Auto emails for billing & match notifications (templating per tenant).

18. Example acceptance test scenarios (basic)

Scenario A — Job creation & match generation

Employer creates job via UI.

System enqueues parse job.

ML service parses description and returns skills + embedding.

Worker upserts embedding and executes match query.

Matches appear in employer UI with explanations.

Employer provides feedback; feedback stored.

Scenario B — Job-seeker application

Job-seeker uploads resume.

Profile populated and set to public.

Employer match finds candidate; employer invites candidate.

Candidate gets email and marks interest.
